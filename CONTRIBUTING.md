## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For local development, you will need the following tools:

- [uv (Python management tool)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)
- A running [PostgreSQL](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/) service.

### Local Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CMLPlatform/relab
   cd relab
   ```

1. **Install Development Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend                  # Change to the backend directory
   uv sync                     # Install dependencies
   uv run pre-commit install   # Install pre-commit hooks
   ```

1. Set up the app by following the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md#local-setup) (skip dependencies installation as you've done this in the step above).

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

Start the development server by navigating to the [`backend`](backend) directory and running the fastapi development server:

```bash
cd backend
uv run fastapi dev app/main.py
```

The API will be available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

### Code Style Guidelines

We follow RESTful API design and the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for Python code, but use a line length of 120 characters.

We use several tools to ensure code quality:

1. [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and code style enforcement (see [`pyproject.toml`](backend/pyproject.toml) for rules):

   ```bash
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run ruff format .
   ```

1. [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for static type checking:

   ```bash
   uv run pyright
   ```

1. [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks automatically run these checks and more before committing (see the [pre-commit configuration](backend/.pre-commit-config.yaml) for the full list of checks). You can check and format your code manually using:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### Testing

The project uses pytest for testing:

1. **Running Tests**

   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```

1. **Writing Tests**

   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Use fixtures for test setup
   - Mock external dependencies

### Database Migrations

When making changes to the database schema:

1. **Create a Migration**

   ```bash
   uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
   ```

1. **Review the Generated Migration**
   Review the migration file in `alembic/versions/` to ensure it correctly captures your changes.

1. **Apply the Migration**

   ```bash
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Create a Feature Branch**
   If not already done, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repository and create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

1. **Make and Commit Changes**

   - Implement your feature or fix, following the [code style guidelines](#code-style-guidelines).

   - Use the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format when committing changes:

     ```bash
     <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
     ```

     > ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can use `uv run cz commit` to create conventional commits in the correct format.

1. **Submit Pull Request**

   - Push to your fork:

     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

   - Create a pull request against the main repository

   - Provide a clear description and reference related issues

   - Address review feedback

All contributions must pass automated checks and receive approval before merging.
