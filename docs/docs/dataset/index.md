# Dataset Documentation

The Reverse Engineering Lab platform hosts a comprehensive dataset of disassembled durable goods to support circular economy research and computer vision applications.

## Overview

The dataset contains high-quality images and metadata of disassembled power tools, providing detailed information about components, materials, and assembly relationships. This data supports:

- **Computer vision tasks** - Object detection, segmentation, classification
- **Life cycle assessments** - Material identification and quantification
- **Circular economy research** - Disassembly sequence analysis
- **Remanufacturing studies** - Component condition assessment
